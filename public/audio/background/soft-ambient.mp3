I've implemented a comprehensive dynamic greeting feature for Sonix with the following capabilities:

## Key Features:

1. **Dynamic Greetings**: 8 different greeting variations with different tones and styles
2. **Voice Modulation**: Simulated voice variations (pitch, speed, tone) for natural diversity
3. **Background Music**: Soft ambient music plays during greetings
4. **Visual Speaking Animation**: Sonix avatar pulses and shows speaking indicators
5. **Audio Controls**: Volume control and mute functionality
6. **Smart Playback**: Greetings play automatically when chat opens, with cooldown to prevent spam

## Components Added:

- **GreetingService**: Manages greeting selection and voice modulation
- **EnhancedSonixAssistant**: Visual avatar with speaking animations
- **Background Music**: Soft ambient audio during greetings
- **Audio Controls**: Integrated volume and mute controls

## Features:

- **Randomized Greetings**: Different greeting each time
- **Voice Variations**: Simulated pitch and speed changes
- **Visual Feedback**: Pulsing avatar and speaking indicators
- **Audio Management**: Background music with proper volume control
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

The system creates a more engaging and personalized experience with Sonix, making each interaction feel fresh and dynamic!
